Now, though, I see goodness and grace everywhere: in Cordelia\'s plain-spoken honesty and love for Lear, in Kent and Gloster\'s loyalty, in Edgar\'s bizarre attempt to heal his father\'s soul through stratagem, and--perhaps most important--in the way Lear himself grows in understanding and compassion even as he grows in grief and madness.

Even though my inexpensive Wordsworth edition wasn’t generous with annotations or academic essays, the universality of Shakespeare’s art, wrought in versed polyptotons, playful aphorisms and grotesque imagery, surpasses all attempts to categorize his work. Always elusive and prone to countless interpretations, Shakespeare remains inscrutable and daunts the present reader with questions of yesteryear about the meaning of life.',

However, apart from a summary and laundry list of policies and goals, there is no philosophical or argumentative basis (or support or examples for that matter) to persuade the reader as to why their approach is the right or best or appropriate approach to begin with... which leaves this book with all kinds of assumptions and holes, and leaving it utterly uninteresting to read.

But, when read in the light (or shadows) of the last eight years under the Bush administration, Obama's vision is a breath of fresh air that allows you to once again ponder what America is truly capable of accomplishing. When read in comparison with the muddled, status quo policies being hocked by McCain, it is difficult to see how any critical thinking citizen with a social conscience could not easily prefer Obama's proposal. `,

Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.

          Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.

          Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.`,

Scary thoughts, but in the end, at least the right people got something back they deserved, even if it wasn't as much as it should have been.

              The characters are very clear and strong. And when there are upwards of 10 to 12 supporting or lead female characters, an author has to spend a tremendous amount of time creating distinct pictures in a readers mind. Stockett did a great job with this task. Each and every one shows you a different personality: leaders and followers, movers and shakers, smart and silly, strong and weak, tolerant and intolerant, thirsty for all the world has to offer and content to stay the same for an entire lifetime.`,

Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell\'s nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff\'s attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell\'s prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written. ',

              But in the long run, all that does not matter, because George Orwell got it right.

              Orwell, a socialist who fought against Franco, watched appalled as the great Soviet experiment was reduced to a totalitarian state, a repressive force equal in evil to Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. He came to realize that ideology in an authoritarian state is nothing but a distraction, a shiny thing made for the public to stare at. He came to realize that the point of control was more control, the point of torture was more torture, that the point of all their "alternative facts" was to fashion a world where people would no longer possess even a word for truth. `,

The Hobbit defines the high fantasy genre along with its sequel, of course, and has been an inspiration to countless authors and readers alike. Tolkien, quite literally, kick started a genre that would eventually capture the hearts of thousands of people. He changed the literary world. He made fantasy real. ',
